# A Banking Workflow AKS Cluster using DAPR [WIP]

This sample creates an AKS Cluster and uses DAPR for service mesh. The project is built using [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/make-azd-compatible?pivots=azd-create) conventions.

## How it works?

This sample implements a simple banking workflow:

1. Public API endpoint receives new money transfer request. [TRANSFER(Sender: A, Amount: 100, Receiver:B)]
1. Request is published to Redis (pub/sub)
1. Deposit workflow starts
    1. Fraud service checks the legitimacy of the operation and triggers [VALIDATED(Sender: A, Amount: 100, Receiver:B)]
    1. Account service checks if `Sender` has enough funds and triggers [APPROVED(Sender: A, Amount: 100, Receiver: B)]
    1. [WIP] Notification services notifies both `Sender` and `Receiver`.
1. Public API can be used to check if there is a confirmation of the money transfer request.

![Workflow](/docs/flow.drawio.png)

## Services

The project contains the following services:

- [Public API](/src/public-api-service) - Public API endpoint that receives new money transfer requests, starts workflow and checks customer notifications.
- [Fraud Service](/src/fraud-service) - Fraud service that checks the legitimacy of the operation.
- [Account Service](/src/account-service) - Account service that checks if `Sender` has enough funds.
- [Notification Service](/src/notification-service) - Notification service that notifies both `Sender` and `Receiver` by updating/inserting transfer requests in the Public APIs state store.

## Prerequisites

Following technologies and CLIs are used for the development. Follow the links to install them:

- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/make-azd-compatible?pivots=azd-create)
- [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [Redis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)

**Alternatively** you can use [DevContainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for local development. Opening the project with VS Code will automatically install all the required tools and extensions using DevContainers.

## Getting Started

We use [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) to automate the build and deployment process. You can run the following command to see the available commands:

```bash
make help
```

The following commands are available:

```bash

## Local Dev Environment Setup

Local environment is setup using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/). Kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes". Kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but can be used for local development or CI.

### 1. Local Environment Setup

Running following command to setup your local development environment using `Docker` and `Kind`:

```bash
make start-local
```

This script runs the followings:

1. Creates a local Docker registry called `kind-registry` running locally on port 9999.
1. Creates a Kind cluster called `azd-aks` using config file from [kind-cluster-config.yaml](/local/kind-cluster-config.yaml).
1. Connects the registry to the cluster network if not already connected so deployments can access the local registry.
1. Maps the local registry to the cluster
1. Deploys [Redis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/) to the cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) [chart](https://bitnami.com/stack/redis/helm) to use for different Dapr components (pub/sub, state store, etc).
1. Deploys [Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/) on your local cluster.
1. Deploys [Pub/Sub Broker](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/pubsub-overview/) using Redis as the message broker using [redis.yaml](./local/components/redis.yaml) Dapr component.

Your local cluster will be laid out as follows:

![Local](/docs/local.drawio.png)

### 2. Dapr Dashboard & Components

You can validate that the setup finished successfully by navigating to <http://localhost:9000>. This will open the [Dapr dashboard](/docs/dapr-dashboard.png) in your default browser. This assumes you installed [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/) in your local machine.

```bash
make dapr-dashboard
```

To verify the installation of pub/sub broker and other components:

```bash
make dapr-components
```

This will output something similar to the following:

```bash
NAMESPACE  NAME                   TYPE          VERSION  SCOPES  CREATED              AGE
default    money-transfer-pubsub  pubsub.redis  v1               2023-05-10 11:25.24  10m
default    money-transfer-state   state.redis   v1               2023-05-10 11:25.24  10m
```

### 3. Deploy Services to Cluster

By convention, every service under `/src` folder has 2 files:

1. [Dockerfile](/src/public-api-service/Dockerfile) - Dockerfile for building the service image.
1. [local-deploy.sh](/src/public-api-service/local-deploy.sh) - Script file to build, publish and deployment the latest code to local cluster as Docker image.

To deploy all services to the cluster, run the following command under `scripts` folder:

```bash
make deploy
```

The deployment script will do the following:

1. Build and publish the Docker image for each service.
1. Deploy the image to the local cluster.
1. Create a Kubernetes service for each service.
1. Register the service with Dapr.

The output of the local deployment of each service will be similar to following:

```bash

```

### 4. Connecting to Public API Service

[Public API](/src/public-api-service) is deployed as `Loadbalancer` service type. In local cluster setup, it will not able to get public IP to connect.
Instead, you can access this service locally using the Kubectl proxy tool.

```bash
make port-forward-local
```

While this command is running, you can access the service at <http://localhost:8080>.

An example request to start a new transfer workflow is:

```curl
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/transfers \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "sender": "A",
    "receiver": "B",
    "amount": 100
}'
```

You can query the status of a transfer:

```curl
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/transfers/{transferId} \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### 5. Delete Local Cluster

If you'd like to create a clean state and start over, you can run the following command to delete the local cluster and all the resources associated with it.

```bash
make clean
```

## Implementation Status

- [X] Public API endpoint receives new money transfer request. [TRANSFER(Sender: A, Amount: 100, Receiver:B)]
- [X] Request is published to Redis (pub/sub)
- [X] Deposit workflow starts
  - [X] Fraud service checks the legitimacy of the operation and triggers [VALIDATED(Sender: A, Amount: 100, Receiver:B)]
  - [X] Account service checks if `Sender` has enough funds and triggers [APPROVED(Sender: A, Amount: 100, Receiver: B)]
  - [ ] Notification services notifies both `Sender` and `Receiver`.
- [X] Public API can be used to check if there is a confirmation of the money transfer request.

## How To

Following are practical operator guides for common tasks.

### How to Operate Redis

To connect to Redis, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec -it redis-master-0 -- redis-cli
```

To get Redis password:

```bash
kubectl get secret --namespace default redis -o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode
```

To AUTH with Redis instance for further operations

```bash
AUTH <password>
```

Get all keys in the state store:

```bash
keys *
```
